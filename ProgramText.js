    story_title: "Change as a Form of Death",
    story_body: `One of the most powerful lessons I learned in my education and training is the idea that change, in often small, but nonetheless important ways is a kind of death. Moving to a new house, or town, or school, causes a person to recognize that things are not as they once were.
    
This is true even when the change is potentially a good thing.
    
Researchers at Stanford looked at how much people would save for a future self depending on their appearance and future traits. People saved significantly less for future selves unlike them. This makes sense, because when you change, you are a different person, a stranger. As such that current self is dead in a meaningful way. That’s part of the challenge of changing behaviors, you are killing a self in some sense and creating a stranger.`,

      "When have you been able/not able to identify with your future self? How can you better be able to recognize change in your life?",
